Hey! I’m Marwan, a Computer Science major at The University of Texas at Dallas with a passion for building systems that create real impact. I’m especially interested in the space where tech meets healthcare, and I’m driven by the goal of making access to quality care more equitable through smart, data-driven solutions.

Along the way, I’ve had the chance to explore research, engineering, and teaching. I’ve presented academic research on AI in medical diagnosis, built predictive models using real-world data, and served as a section lead for Stanford’s Intro to Python course, where I helped students strengthen their programming skills. I’m also proud to be part of communities like ColorStack and Delta Tau Delta, all while staying focused on academic excellence.

This site is a collection of what I’ve been working on — projects, research, blog posts, and more. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, collaborate, or just chat.
